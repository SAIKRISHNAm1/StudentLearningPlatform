# StudentLearningPlatform
Developed a web-based Online Learning Portal where users can register, log in, enroll in courses, access enrolled courses, and update their profile details. The system also allows an admin to add new courses to the database. The application follows the MVC pattern and uses JSP, Servlets, and JDBC for backend processing and MySQL for data storage.
